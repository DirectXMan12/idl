# KDL

This contains work-in-progress stuff for KDL, the Kubernetes IDL.

You probably want to look at [the example](./examples/corev1).

Otherwise, you might want [VIM syntax highlighting](./kdl.vim), if you're
opening examples in VIM.

There's also *technically* the WIP Go rewrite of the KDL compiler from its
initial prototype form (the prototype, which is not here, was written in
Rust). Don't read that yet, it's not done ;-).
